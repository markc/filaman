# FilaMan - Filament Manager Documentation

## Project Overview

FilaMan (Filament Manager) is a Laravel 12 application built with Filament 4 beta, following a modular plugin-based architecture. The core application is kept minimal, with all features implemented as separate plugins.

## Filament v4.x Compliance

**CRITICAL**: All plugins and development MUST follow Filament v4.x standards:

- **Official Guidelines**: https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/introduction/overview
- **CRUD Operations**: All plugin CRUD actions MUST be handled in the admin panel at `/admin/{plugin}` unless specifically documented otherwise
- **Theme Consistency**: Use Filament's default theme and styling system
- **Component Standards**: Utilize Filament's unified Schema components for forms, tables, and widgets
- **Panel Integration**: Properly integrate with Filament's panel architecture

## Current Progress

### âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Laravel 12 & Filament 4 Beta Installation**
   - Fresh Laravel 12 installation configured
   - Filament 4 beta installed with `minimum-stability: beta`
   - Panel builder setup completed with `php artisan filament:install --panels`

2. **Plugin Architecture Setup**
   - Created `plugins/` directory for housing plugins
   - Installed `awcodes/hydro` globally for plugin scaffolding
   - Generated first plugin: `AdminPanelPlugin`

3. **AdminPanelPlugin Configuration**
   - Updated namespace from `Mark-constable` to `FilaMan` (PHP-compatible)
   - Updated Filament dependencies to v4.0 in plugin's composer.json
   - Configured local package repository in main composer.json
   - Implemented Filament Plugin interface with proper registration

4. **Core Integration**
   - Registered AdminPanelPlugin in AdminPanelProvider
   - Configured plugin autoloading
   - Created basic Dashboard page within plugin
   - Set up plugin discovery for Resources, Pages, and Widgets

### âœ… Authentication System

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Environment-aware authentication system
   - Local development: Auto-login as admin (no authentication required)
   - Production: Full email-based MFA with verification
   - Role-based access control (Admin/User roles)
   - Native Filament 4 integration

5. **User Management**: Complete user system ready
   - User model implements FilamentUser interface
   - Database schema with role and 2FA columns
   - Admin and test users seeded
   - Role-based authorization patterns implemented

### ðŸš§ Current Status

The project now has a complete foundation with:
- Plugin-based modular architecture
- Environment-aware authentication system
- Role-based authorization framework
- Development and production configurations

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` (auto-login in local)
2. **Create Feature Resources**: Build resources with role-based authorization
3. **Add Business Logic**: Implement domain-specific features as plugins
4. **Production Deployment**: Configure email services for MFA
